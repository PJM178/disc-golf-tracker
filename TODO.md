Initial schema ideas:
- localStorage object meta fields: current active game (to load it as active when opening the app)
- localStorage object game state: start time, end time, players, location of the course (device location), holes (add holes as you go or maybe a choice of templating them beforehand) - array of objects, hole done, score, total game score
